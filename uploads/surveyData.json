The fact that I can see my work directly effecting the floor, (as in stock and facing and all that) is satisfying","38":"My direct supervisor is fun to work with and let's me know what and when I need to get tasks done. Can't really ask for more to be honest","39":"I don't have much experience with HR but it seems good from the little I have dealt with them.","40":"Kinda in a blind spot being in overnight. I don't see 80% of how things are done when the doors are open","41":"I honestly don't know much about the compensation in the area. Newish to the area and it's my first job after moving","42":"Medical insurance|Dental insurance|Vision insurance|Paid time off|Sick time|Staff discount|Floating holidays","43":"I see a day fair management team that doesn't abuse the power of the position","44":"A nice environment to work with people that are understanding","45":"overall the coop is the best job ive had. id give it a 8/10","46":"other than wanting it to be easier to develop i have no complaints","47":"i never needed to go to hr for anything\n","48":"i like my department and my department manager.","49":"for the most part the store runs smoothly.the only thing i can think of to help the operations is if we didnt need to rely on category management to bring in new products.","50":"the pay is outstanding when it comes to other jobs. more free food.","51":"Dental insurance|Medical insurance|Paid time off|Floating holidays|Staff discount","52":"i dont understand what this is asking","53":"communication on a day to day basis is perfect. i always know whats going on. when it comes to sales, end cap, holidays, displays, scheduling etc the coop does an excellent job at those too.the only flaw is is communication when it comes to moving up.","54":"Paylocity announcements|Postings (in the breakroom| etc.)","55":"my only complaint with the management practices of the coop is it seems like things only get done when the coop can benefit from it. it seems like if the coop feels like they cant benefit from something it will not get done. regardless of what the employees say or feel.the coop needs to be a little more honest with their employees. A \"no\"is much more transparent than touching bases or looking into it.","56":"the experience at the coop has been eventful to say the least. i have met a few good people, others are meh. i wish i could withdraw from the union, i feel like it doesn't represent my values and has given too much power to people whose performance is lackluster (to my knowledge) or people who are never here. i feel taken advantage of because we no longer have performance based raises making it demotivating . i also think late and call offs should be marked differently to incentivize people to come in.call offs and leaving early without a good reason should be handled with slightly more firmness. it is disappointing to see people who more than me or occupy a higher position than leaving early as often as they do.","57":"I'd love to be able to do more training of team members.I think there's opportunity to have TMs do some smaller orders (for example, something like being responsible for ordering just the UNFI packaged teas) which would help take some work off the dept manager's plate and would also promote more team ownership over their own dept.\n\nThe issue right now is that with what has seemed like little consequence for TMs not working their full shift or even showing up, we normally aren't able to find enough time for cross training in other dept duties/responsibilities.\n\nSometimes we need to give up a little bit of control over some of the dept responsibilities in favor of teaching new skills to TMs, this would help to keep TMs more engaged with their work. Even if TMs don't plan to work at the co-op as a career they could feel like they've learned skills that can translate to other employment/industries.We need to find the motivating factors that make TMs want to excel and see value in their work at the co-op instead of being content with just doing the bare minimum.","58":"We haven't really been able to have dept meetings yet though our manager has wanted to.Having a lot of call offs/leaves in grocery and only one receiver has made it so that overlap between the shifts is more difficult. It seems like the dept manager is attempting to cover a lot of gaps and that leaves little time to interact with staff.","59":"I think that department managers and buyers are often \"dumped\"into positions without given proper training or a clear list of expectations.We still need to work on our training systems for managers so that there's not such a gap/dip in dept performance or issues with inter-dept communication.Some type of training with clearly listed tasks that can be checked off in a logical order as each item is mastered/understood. \n\nI've seen some pretty basic things overlooked.For example, how is it that a Front End Manager can be here for weeks or months and not even know that we have a dishwasher in the break room?It feels like there's a disconnect here somewhere. \n\nTo be honest, I'm not really sure where a clear description of my job is at the moment.Where can we electronically pull up that information?","60":"Even though all staff have been assigned harassment training, there still seem to be issues with staff not coming forward at times when they're uncomfortable with what they feel are discrimination related to race, gender or sexual orientation.Perhaps there's an issue with work culture or maybe there need to be more interactive (non-computer based) training models.Maybe there are some team building exercise opportunities?\n\nI'm not really clear (looking at the union handbook) on what the consequences are for leaving a shift early without permission.I feel like this is becoming an issue all around and it has been discussed with management.It doesn't help when supervisors are modeling the behavior (clocking out early without a medical excuse or otherwise) and there feels to be no accountability in relation to it.","61":"We have some employees that have recently stated that they refuse to do certain tasks, which are part of their regularly stated tasks in their position.The issue has been brought up with management.We are going to be sitting down and talking about the expectations and procedures to work with when we have employees that state that they refuse to comply. If there's a reasonable accommodation that needs to be made, we can work with that.An employee simply stating that they refuse to do a task, with no further explanation or followup, is not acceptable though.","62":"I think there are some systems that have sort of fallen away and that we may find value in bringing back.\n\nWe rarely give product to the kitchen when it's no longer suitable for produce.While we do bring brown bananas over to bakery, I think there's opportunity with more overnight bakers to go back to peeling and freezing bananas again when there's an excess (not to make a habit of over-ordering, but sometimes they do end up being composted instead of use in bakery because they can't take too many at once.)\n\nI think there's opportunity to use more Produce shrink items on the salad bar, which may also create more excitement for the customers by adding a little more random-ish variety.\n\nAfter replacing the back (swinging) receiving door, the sign asking staff to lock the door behind them when not in view (within about six feet or visual distance) was lost.We need a new sign because this is a security/safety issue and staff need to be fully aware of the expectation. \n\nWe have been asking for new Box Cutters for nearly six months and have not received any yet.This is a basic supply needed to do work.\n\nWe also do not have many freezer gloves, which have been requested multiple times.\nWe should consider giving each team member a fresh/clean pair of freezer gloves when they begin working a refrigerated/frozen dept, to be responsible for as theirs .Gloves can carry bacteria and germs and especially with pandemic/contagious illness concerns it feels like we should not be sharing porous gloves between staff.\n\nIt feels like we've been asking for the Grocery Freezer/cooler coats to be washed for over a year.They can't be sanitary at this point.\n\nAnyone who's in a position for purchasing/ordering could benefit from some basic buying classes.Pars on tags, using movement reports efficiently, etc contribute to avoiding over ordering, which contributes to shrink.The more over-ordering that takes place, the more product is moved from backstock to floor and back to the back room again which wastes time and labor.I see us heading in a better direction with this than we were a year ago but there's still room to improve.\n\nThe fact that Hertel Grocery-Bakery(Bread) has 15% shrink for a quarter is WILD to me.We've par'd the frozen/UNFI bread tags and kept a close eye on stocking so we know this is generally not the problem area.We need tighter turnaround on adjusting local bread orders/shrink, possibly by shrinking the facings (we've talked about it and done a little bit of this) but we waste a TON of time and labor pulling bread and Sweet Pea product and shrinking it.While we're on the topic of Sweet Pea, please bring in more vegan options and less items containing dairy, the vegan options often seem to sell out faster than the non-vegan items.\n\nThere's also too much stuff/supplies stored on top of the employee lockers, some of it I'd guess is left over from when we had a more intense demo program, we need to do a purge.All of the marketing signs behind the door in the buyer's office also are kind of out of control, every time you need to close the door to have a private conversation you're risking an avalanche of signs falling down on you.\n\nI'd love to see the dept managers from both stores do a periodic visit to each other's locations to talk about possible systems improvements and to bounce ideas off of each other.\n\nThe Hertel Buyer's office has too much stuff stored underneath the computer desks.This is a fire safety hazard and a general clutter issue.\n\nI also am still not a fan of the kitchen emptying the hot water wells into unattended buckets at the end of the night. In the rare case that a child may come in late at night this feels like a burn hazard.There also have been multiple times lately when the buckets have overflowed and made a large wet spill on the floors.In the least, if we can consider an option with a lid so that a child's hand couldn't possibly reach into the stream of water or the bucket, that would be a big improvement. \n\nPlease make sure that all pans in the PFD kitchen fridge have a lid on them when stored.It's disheartening to see uncovered product in the cooler as this could be a contamination/food safety and health dept issue.If the issue is that we need more lid, let's order more.If staff isn't compliant then let's make sure we're tracking/initialing who's panning things up and taking care of which tasks for each night so that we can have more accountability.","63":"I think there's opportunity for us to help customers and staff learn how to shop at the co-op on a weekly budget. I don't feel like I see enough customers, and not nearly enough employees inspired to make this one of their main stops for shopping.We need to overcome the idea that we're only for certain types of customers.I don't see staff taking advantage of their employee discount (for themselves) as much as I feel like they could potentially.When staff is inspired to purchase and try our products they are better equipped to help customers to make shopping decisions, whether it be based off of quality, value or simply to be able to describe a product to someone.","64":"Medical insurance|Dental insurance|Vision insurance|Paid time off|Sick time|Floating holidays|Retirement plan|Staff discount","65":"See previous comments","66":"I have heard from some staff that the postings all over the break room are too \"busy\"and often below eye level, in areas like the doorway which aren't convenient. We should try to streamline a better system for where to find the information that changes weekly, instead of posting it close proximity to all of the other general work related (NYS/Federal info posters, etc) info.\n\nI don't think the Open Book Management huddle is very helpful for the PM, Overnight Shifts or for staff who can't otherwise make it.I think we could benefit from returning to a \"shift huddle\"model that we used in the past where the dept manager checks in with the team working the shift and gives them an update on current events. Not everyone benefits from simply having information on a paper, some people learn more from interacting in the conversation.\n\nFrom my experience of the OBM huddle, I think there's more opportunity to use the information in a \"what can we change/do differently with this information\"sense vs what seems like a usually redundant metrics listing, snack tasting, \"getting to sit down for an hour and get away from work\"kind of huddle.The huddle should be to inspire us to do better work, not to \"escape\"from work. \n\nPerhaps some voluntary financial/leadership classes for employees could help them to better understand where they could have a greater impact in the day to day work.I think one thing we've always been challenging by (especially after the pandemic hit) is thinking more \"proactively\"and less \"reactively\"","67":"Weekly Need to Know|Paylocity announcements","68":"I'm not really sure that the policies on attendance are clear or followed through on.I have brought up the issue to management about employees who seem to leave early on a regular basis because they state that they simply \"feel like it\",which I have never understood to be a legitimate reason in retail to leave a shift early.I know we are working on more clearly defining the expectations and procedure for attendance and leaving early, as well as how to communicate those expectations and the possible consequences to staff.I don't think we're quite there yet but I hope that everyone is able to get on the same page in this regard.","69":"Paid time off|Sick time|Staff discount","70":"Weekly Need to Know|Postings (in the breakroom| etc.)","71":"eh","72":"Supervision here is good overall. Many of our Supervisors are good, a few are exceptional, and some leave a lot to be desired.","73":"My orientation left me woefully unprepared. The knowledge imparted to me was incomplete and idealistic nonsense that did nothing to aid me practically upon my first true day of work. Specifically, any factual information on our practices was glossed over, and union information was entirely ignored. I was also unable to be properly trained during my initial probation period due to the extreme staffing issues. What I could learn was well taught and professional, but even now I find things I should have been trained on and never was. Because it is currently impossible for enough time and attention to be paid to new hires.","74":"nah","75":"It is a hot mess, and we are lucky to be holding on right now. Most of our managers are good, a select few not so much, but there is so much miscommunication. As well as many instances of uninformed ordering for supplies that will delay production for at least a day, usually more. Not to mention the fact that we are criminally understaffed.","76":"ha.","77":"A lot of people here deserve to be paid a lot more. The Coop drags its feet when it comes to earned compensation, especially when it comes to giving adequate raises.","78":"Weekly Need to Know|Postings (in the breakroom| etc.)|Paylocity announcements","79":"Open book Management seems to provide an illusion of in depth understanding of the Coop's business management more than anything else.","80":"I know of some questionable management practices that have been enacted since the institution of our union. By and large these decisions seem to have come from a place of ignorance rather than maliciousness on the part of the Co-op, which doesn't absolve them but is rather more forgivable.","81":"No comment","82":"Often times I see people with the same title doing drastically different levels of work and this can be very frustrating. A clear indication on the work you have to do as different level team members would probably reduce some of the frustration.","83":"Paid time off|Sick time|Medical insurance|Retirement plan|Staff discount|Floating holidays","84":"","85":"The Co-op is a great grocery store for specific items. We cater to just about all diets and food allergens.However, Sometimes I feel as if the desire to be like other grocery stores gets in the way of our vision and mission statement.","86":"Despite there being room to improve (every job does), I enjoy this job heavily. The majority of my coworkers are hardworking, reliable, fun, and supportive both emotionally and physically. We offer products that I am happy to stand behind - locally sourced, with ethical and sustainable business practices. I tell everyone our produce, meat, and cheese stand out noticeably - not even Wegmans matches our produce quality and variety for the size that we are as a store.","87":"On the job training is not clear enough/not long enough, or at least, if an employee is struggling to perform, there is not a system in play to come back and support that person to succeed. Have witnessed minimal training lead to mistakes in ordering items needed, which leads to a departmental struggle that could have easily been avoided. Have seen employees struggle to create product effectively and continue to be scheduled to complete said product without hands on support. Not much clarity in who is the \"trainer\"- everyone can help and assist their team members, but if team members do not ask/do not alert others to needing help, this becomes ineffective. Coworkers do not have the same \"power\"and \"enforcement\"as management as well to make sure good work practices are happening - they should not be the \"front line\". More attentiveness on behalf of management to this would help.","88":"Food quality is unpredictable. Products often put out that are not meeting standards - overbaked/underbaked, not uniform, often out of date items are still on shelves in PFD/Bakehouse. Some items have sell by dates that, in my personal opinion, are too long - items already hard/stale before then. Maybe one day less on cookies, krispies, etc. A few employees have \"tribal knowledge\"about recipes and how to do them that is not explicitly explained on the recipe itself.","89":"I notice system structures that could be improved upon. Organization of work spaces, office or otherwise, is often cluttered and messy. Small, yet important, items such as pens, highlighters, notepads, and sharpies are not predictably ordered. System for finding/making new nametags is unclear. Breakroom table is full of random items, cluttering the eating space. Coatrack/locker areas often filled with aprons not being used or discarded into the bin to be washed, taking up space to actually hang coats.","90":"Generous retirement matching opportunity. Introduction of sick time was an excellent addition. Medical insurance is always a great option.","91":"Medical insurance|Paid time off|Sick time|Floating holidays|Retirement plan|Staff discount|Vision insurance|Dental insurance","92":"Could use work - supply outages affecting work output are not often communicated, or found out only when starting a task that was delegated.","93":"Weekly Need to Know|Paylocity announcements|Postings (in the breakroom| etc.)","94":"Great produce, great meat, great cheese.","95":"Our new PTO/sick policy has been helpful with medical appointments.","96":"Medical insurance|Dental insurance|Paid time off|Sick time|Floating holidays|Retirement plan|Staff discount","97":"Paylocity announcements|Weekly Need to Know","98":"Paid time off|Floating holidays|Retirement plan|Staff discount","99":"Very open-minded community. Feels like an open and comfortable environment for the most part.","100":"I am fortunate to work in a department where there is (currently) such cohesion and cooperation. The communication isn't always there, but it is for the most part.","101":"I can't really speak about the communication between stores, but what I have observed over the last several months is poor communication between admin and Elmwood and poor communication throughout Elmwood.","102":"Medical insurance|Dental insurance|Vision insurance|Paid time off|Staff discount|Retirement plan|Floating holidays|Sick time","103":"I appreciate the recent efforts to communicate information via the NTK, but there are still many instances when vital communication does not reach those who would need it, creating all sorts of negative feelings, which could be avoided.","104":"It's been tough to watch an almost entirely novice SLT make decisions that impact the entire co-op and its staff. It's been tough to watch tenured employees leave because of particular members of the SLT or because of decisions made or actions taken by the SLT.","105":"I find the Co-op (through its store-level staff at both stores) to be less friendly than it once was. I don't fault the staff entirely. I feel that there is general disenchantment or discord with staff and either their direct managers or the general manager. This is unfortunate because it does trickle down to the customer/owner experience and it does drag overall co-op morale down. It's also unfortunate that staff and owners cannot contact the Board without the general manager being included in the communication.\n","106":"Sofia is wonderful and has changed the way that HR interacts with the Ops team in all positive ways!","107":"While I'm generally happy with the performance of my team, there are many things we need to improve on.","108":"Broken equipment through out the store is not typically fixed in a timely fashion. The bakery freezer has been broken for over a month, and the uboat in our tiny walk in freezer is beyond frustrating at this point. The 3-bay sink situation is a good example of why a store manager who is not knowledgable about kitchen equipment should not be the one buying kitchen equipment. I think this roots in a lack of communication between department managers and the store manager.","109":"The benefits at the Coop are wonderful and I feel fortunate to have them. But every year, I lose PTO and Floating Holiday because I don't feel me/my department is supported enough for me to possibly use all the time off I'm given.","110":"Communication from the Store Manager at Elmwood needs improvement. His written communication is poor to non-existent.","111":"Weekly Need to Know|Paylocity announcements|Open Book Management huddles","112":"We have certainly made mistakes and can definitely do better, but I can say sincerely that management is filled with good people with the best intentions, even if this mark is sometimes missed.","113":"While I do think the Coop does a good job supporting local businesses, I think the Coop has become to comfortable in always choosing to align itself with NCG and its' programs we participate in. The Core program does so little to benefit the Coop and its shoppers, and genuinely creates more unnecessary work for Cat Management and the grocery department. I'm also concerned that SLT is grasping for straws to keep Hertel afloat, and possibly making decisions that do not align with our mission, like considering Pepsi as a direct vendor. This is disappointing and lacks any integrity, and makes me concerned for the future of the Coop.","114":"Paid time off|Sick time|Floating holidays|Staff discount|Retirement plan","115":"Dental insurance|Medical insurance|Vision insurance|Paid time off|Sick time|Floating holidays|Staff discount","116":"They are very supportive.","117":"It is a wonderful place to work.","118":"Postings (in the breakroom| etc.)|Weekly Need to Know","119":"Floating holidays|Medical insurance|Paid time off","120":"there are no trainings on racism and the different ways people can be racist or transphobic or antisemitic, and so people who are ignorant continue to be ignorant","121":"Medical insurance|Dental insurance|Vision insurance|Paid time off|Sick time|Floating holidays|Staff discount","122":"i dont really know what that means but yall being more open about plans and movement for the future is nice","123":"the bulletin board is overwhelming and hard to see what is actually useful/beneficial to see","124":"management has a racist bias they should educate themselves more on. we dont do events for holidays of christian and jewish faiths but not muslim??","125":"Medical insurance|Dental insurance|Vision insurance|Paid time off|Sick time|Floating holidays|Retirement plan","126":"Sick time|Paid time off|Floating holidays|Staff discount","127":"You guys gave a raise to the person I reported for sexual harrassment","128":"Medical insurance|Dental insurance|Paid time off|Floating holidays|Staff discount","129":"Weekly Need to Know|Paylocity announcements|Open Book Management huddles|Postings (in the breakroom| etc.)","130":"Paylocity announcements|Open Book Management huddles|Postings (in the breakroom| etc.)|Weekly Need to Know","131":"My manager makes our department better through her creativity and hard work.","132":"Open Book Management huddles|Weekly Need to Know","133":"I don't plan to stay at the co-op long term just due to the nature of the job. There's been a lot of internal turmoil during my time here that makes me hesitant to recommend the co-op as a good place to work. At the end of the day, we are a business so of course profit is a concern but we preach people over profit and I don't necessarily think that happens here. Some of the supervisors/managers are not necessarily the most warm people and it can create an uncomfortable environment. We have a FES who doesn't really do much in terms of helping to cash, any cleaning jobs, etc and then it always feel frustrating when they just command the front end workers around. Higher pay for less responsibility it seems. Overall, it's been okay but these are just some things that could be noted since we are being asked.","134":"I only feel comfortable with some of the FES/FEM","135":"Staff discount|Paid time off|Sick time","136":"I am not sure what that is.","137":"This is a good community.","138":"Very happy with my current supervisor.","139":"There is nowhere for me to be promoted to; because of the merger of Trainer and Coordinator roles the upward mobility has been limited to having to be a department manager or MOD in order to move upwards which is not suitable for all people. Team Member 2 is an unclear role and the title means nothing. Looks bad on rent applications, ect.","140":"I have had very frustrating dealings with HR in the past, but I have not recently needed to engage with them. Most of the discrimination I faced was a few years ago, as far as I know the situation has improved. I have not heard that current HR is very efficient though.","141":"I appreciate the level of communication we have and the commitment to quality work.","142":"Hertel feels like an entire different world, Elmwood people don't know much about it. Grocery helps other departments a lot but few in other departments are trained to help in grocery other than repack. More inter departmental training would be a good thing.","143":"Union made the pay a lot more fair. Before that raises were insufficient. I wish insurance was not so expensive.","144":"If this information is publicly available that has not been made known to me","145":"Open Book Management huddles|Paylocity announcements|Weekly Need to Know","146":"Management will kick someone out for racist remarks immediately but let transphobic comments or even harassment slide again and again.","147":"I would agree more if we didn't still have an employee that refuses to respect others, and continues to work here despite numerous issues. While other employees have been penalized worst despite doing less.","148":"Daily task should be consistent for all employees in the department. Front end member's should not be expected to clean walls, grates and/or any task that is dehumanizing. If there are too many cashiers, the grocery or PFD departments should be prioritized over cleaning task. Perhaps and overnight cleaning position should be opened to address those concerns.","149":"These are the strongest pillars to employee retention and should not be reduced or affected without employee approval.","150":"Communication needs to increase in regards to coaching, warnings and anything related to our hourly pay (PTO, RTO, etc).Despite such information being available through Paylocity, MOD's and the Store Manager do not appear to be on the same page when it comes to what employees are allowed to do and how much leeway some employees benefit from versus others.","151":"Fellow employees have expressed discomfort with the racial biases expressed at their hair, especially as others of not the same race do not receive such comments or are not asked to \"tame\"their hair.\nThere is also a lack of follow through after employees or managers have been reported for misconduct or harassment.","152":"There needs to be a focus on Anti-racism training for our supervisors. Specifically in regards to biases related to hair and language.","153":"My direct supervisor is fair and listens my suggestions. We work very well as a team and they often seek my input on all aspects of projects. They uphold high standards for the Co-op andI know I can go go them with any problems and that they will be addressed quickly.They often let me know when I'm doing a good job and if I make any mistakes we quickly address them in a productive manner.","154":"My supervisor is overworked and I do not get the training for my job because there is not enough time to complete the necessary work. We were supposed to hire someone six months ago.","155":"We have not had astable HR department in a couple of years. The HR manager is often on leave and HR coordinator over the years is always overworked. We do not have enough stable HR people to do the hiring that is needed, we're often way behind on hiring, and I don't feel like the department is capable of handling the needs of the organization.","156":"Given how short staffed we are, I often do not feel like I'm able to do high quality work.","157":"Store operations is often understaffed and have way too many call outs. We make it to easy to call out when the system is leaving a voicemail.","158":"Given we can never maintain staffing, I don't feel fairly compensated for my job because I'm often having to do the workload of 2-3 people not only in my department, but also carrying the load for others.This is the same for the rest of the story. How often are we short staffed on the front end, grocery and PFD that those who are here have to work harder.","159":"Management soften makes decisions that impact the whole store, front-end, grocery etc, but then do a poor job communicating those changes to TEST of the store. They talk about so much among themselves and leaves little time to email others.It doesnt help that the marketing department has been severely understaffed for almost a year.","160":"There are not any open channels for communicating crit for improving stores processes if it's not tired directly to your department. Anytime I have suggestions for improving systems, I'm told it's up to the store managers.The suggestions are therefore never communicated and we're still stuck in a hamster wheel of needing improvement especially given some of our store managers don't have a ton of experience to draw upon.","161":"Paid time off|Floating holidays|Sick time","162":"We have no clearly defined write up policy in our handbook or available to staff at all.

Sorry HR but holy hell, it takes WEEKS to get the simplest task done, we're told we'll get a response in 2 weeks and 2 MONTHS go by. Last time I had a problem I needed HR to solve, I had to go to Tim Bartlett to get a response. And all they needed to do was approve a payroll change that I submitted!! HR needs to do better, so much better.","186":"We have hardly any POC in upper management positions, or hired at all for that matter so our diversity is lacking. \n\nI bring up issues to Ritch and somehow I end up getting lectured for the problem that I bring up to him? He seems to feel the need to 'devil's advocate' for everything, and it's really unnecessary when a TM brings a problem to his attention. A proper response would be something like, 'Thank you for bringing this to my attention, I'll look into it.' But we often get 'Well, you should be doing that thing better too!' (often this applies to housekeeping tasks). Additionally, I understand that when you're a naturally loud person it's challenging to control the volume at which you speak, but in a manager position, he needs to learn. Being legitimately yelled at in front of your peers is disrespectful and hinders his ability to do his job. \n\nBringing up problems to Bill feels almost pointless, because in the moment he will be concerned and seem like he legitimately wants to do something about the problem at hand, but there's hardly ever an follow-through. \n\nWhen wanting to raise a concern, kitchen staff is caught between tell the manager who will yell at me for it for some reason, or tell the manager that won't do anything about it.","187":"I understand that we are a business and need to make money on food we make and sell, so we make new things and do more to have exciting new stuff that people want to buy. All of that makes sense, what doesn't make sense is that we don't actually communicate (or even form) plans for executing new programs, nor do we check in regularly to make sure things are being done as they should be to be the best product or executed safely or that things are being done efficiently. When staff raises these kind of concerns that something isn't being done well, we're 'listened to' in a way that feels like we're just being pandered to like whining children that don't want to do more work. Most of us are not opposed to new programs, in fact we want these things to happen! But we want there to be an actual plan formed before we spend $10k on equipment for it just to have it rot in storage (hello, pizza program?). We want things to be thought through from the perspective of those of us who will actually be making the products, and who have to plan for the production of the day. \n\nThe supervisory staff (at ALL levels) is insufficient in the kitchen. As a person who has worked in this department for many years, I can look around and find that our new hires are working incredibly inefficiently but it's pointless to say something to them, because they have been trained to work in that fashion. It's the few staff, that they don't see working the stations they're working, coming up and randomly going 'You could be doing this better and I'll show you how' CONSTANTLY and it's not enough to undo almost all of the bad habits of hires we've had in the last 2-3 years (probably longer). Not to mention the people who are seeing these bad habits/methods of working are running more high stakes stations and don't have time to constantly retrain staff. We were forced to rely on a single TM2 to train most of the new people we get who doesn't work efficiently, and we hardly ever correct any of the bad habits they've instilled on the trainees. If most TM2s see this, the supervisors should too, and they should be correcting it. The fact that that doesn't happen is on management, Managers should know enough to be able to tell their supervisors to correct work done by TMs and follow through to make sure it actually happens (that part is VITAL).\n\nPlease, PLEASE, learn how to tell people how to do their jobs. \n\nAnd please, for the love of god, communicate better. \n","188":"n/a","189":"Personally I do feel that the coop is a great place to work. I have met people here that I hope to maintain relationships for a long time. Work satisfaction certainly depends on the position. I think it is difficult to derive genuine satisfaction and fulfillment from washing dishes. I give enormous thanks to my coworkers and supervisors for teaching me other tasks aside from dish washing as those gave me much more fulfillment. Seeking greater fulfillment was my main reason for seeking employment elsewhere.","190":"need better communication/follow up. i am often left hanging when posting a question or concern to basecamp and have to needle my leadership the next day or so to get an answer.","191":"Again, the new sink in the kitchen is absolutely inefficient.

For instance, I don't believe the co-op should market globalization because it is contradictory to the local food movement. We don't need to sell tropical fruits, plants that only grow in tropical countries, nor do we need to offer products that feature seasonal ingredients (such as fruit based pastries) year round. People can get these products anywhere and I feel the co-op has a responsibility to disrupt this notion. Nature doesn't provide the same crops or plants everywhere or year round so why should we? Sure, people enjoy products like guacamole and mango salsa and blueberry muffins but none of those products share any meaningful connection to our local environment. I think we could get creative and offer products that feel special and unique to our co-op here in Buffalo, NY. We should feature more pastries that include local ingredients, like NY apples and plants that are native to Western New York. There is a nursery on Niagara Street called Primeval Forest Nursery that specializes in indigenous plants, maybe we could work with them. I think we can do a lot to show people that small localized food systems and communities are far better for us all than big corporate monopolies. Additionally, I think the co-op is a great resource for Elmwood Village but honestly, most of the people shopping here are not very marginalized economically. I think we need to do more to support working class people. Maybe could offer discounts for food service workers, perhaps on a special day or time. Maybe we could do a Pay What You Can on the hot/salad bar sometimes. Maybe we could do more outreach to communities on the West Side so that they know this place exists and it's not just for Elmwood Village socialites. Lastly, I think the co-op needs to seriously evaluate the food waste situation. I appreciate that we donate a significant amount of food and we compost, but we also waste just as much. I believe employees should be able to take home lost product at no cost if it is going to be thrown away. Perhaps we could set up a community fridge even outside to allow community members to access organic food who may not be able to pay for it. I understand the co-op has to be economically sustainable but I think there are things we can do that wouldn't actually hurt us financially at all and in turn, return us to a more socially minded organization.","199":"Sick time|Paid time off|Floating holidays|Retirement plan|Staff discount","200":"Personally I feel that dishwasher wages should be equal to that of a prepared foods or other team member positions.

For example, getting a tag made for the kitchen involves 5 people that the tag must go through before getting printed by an entirely different department.Years ago, kitchen supervisors could just go upstairs, type up and print a tag, laminate it, and get it back down to the sales floor in a matter of minutes.

Many ideas and suggestions from the floor/department staff never make it up to upper management, or fall on deaf ears. For example, many kitchen staff have tried suggesting new recipes for our hot bar, many of which are our own hot bar recipes from before covid, and we never even hear a response as to if and why something was not approved. \nOn the other side, upper management tends to make decisions without consulting those whom would be most affected by the choices.For example, the new kitchen sink is significantly smaller and several types of our dishes do not even fit into the sink to be properly washed.No one who regularly uses the sink was asked nor notified of this until the sink was installed and we saw it for ourselves","242":"Medical insurance|Dental insurance|Paid time off|Floating holidays|Retirement plan|Staff discount","243":"I mean I worked at dash’s so the bar was on the floor, but working here was a great decision.","244":"I would even say that the orientation was too informative haha","245":"I feel like mostly everyone is hands on and ready to work, but some do not uphold their responsibilities to enforcing the front end, such as avoiding register as much as possible (not including being sent to other departments) or not doing the side work.

This is detrimental to the employees adversely affected by these decisions.\n\n","268":"I feel valued by words only, some sort of financial bump, even a one time bonus, would be nice to show the efforts I put in are appreciated.\n\nI recommend the job to friends because it is relatively easy, not perfect, but it's been a nice in-between.\n\nI'd be okay with working at co-op long-term, but internal promotion seems nearly unachievable at times., especially if they'll look at your record from 9+ months ago to see how you're doing *now*\n\nI've been in and out of a lot of jobs, and though I agree my job at co-op is better than the other retail jobs I work, I wish I was able to utilize my skills that I've spent years in college working on more here. Can only bring up so many event and marketing ideas in the huddle before I should just be a marketing guy, y'know?","269":"The recent additions to FE's supervisor and management team have really made my time at co-op a lot better. I'd consider them upgrades in my book. If this question was asked to me before this swap, I'm sure my answer to the above questions would be a lot different.","270":"The Union Contract should be available in print at the front end, just like the handbook is.\nThe employee handbook is...okay. There are things expressed verbally that I think should be expressed clearly in the handbook (IE the 3 in 30 write-up policy). I also think things codified in the union contract, like the dress-code changes, should be updated in the employee handbook.\n\nThere was a time where a customer was being very transphobic to me. A manager had stepped in to help me deal with them at the time, but when I expressed that what was happening *was* transphobic, it wasn't heard. This was confirmed to me when months later, I was told it was just reported as an incident with the customer and no note of its transphobic nature was in the writeup. Things like that needs to be taken more seriously. \n\nThere are enough incidents of customers in the front end touching cashiers, calling them doll and even *finding them on social media,* where I think we should have a longer banlist than we do. I know some people in front end are probably not going to talk about their incidents, I'm not going to drop names, but there are days where I know the transphobic comments and sexualization of some of my co workers will absolutely lead to a dysphoric and horrible day.\n\nHR works really slow here, I send an email out and it can take over 24 hours to get back to me in some cases, even for simple questions. They frankly don't feel trained for the job they're supposed to do, sometimes I get nonanaswers to questions I ask and they feel unhelpful in bigger conversations","271":"The 4 hours of training videos we all just had to do seem very ineffective. Cramming them all into a month span when departments are already understaffed during that month make people rushed to do them. I'm probably not the only one to already forget the details of what I learned a month ago from those trainings. Spread them out during the year so departments only have to find a half hour of time hear and there and not 4+ hours in one fell swoop.\n\nWriteups at the co-op can be used as a \"gotcha\"for promotions, as mentioned previously, I know a couple people who didn't receive promotions and only had minor infractions, atleast thats what co-op said anyway, on their record.\n\nI don't really have goals to work towards, I feel I've already reached the limit of was a FE team member should be doing, even going beyond that. I've received deliveries, worked grocery palettes, worked whole days in the kitchen packing stuff out, and spent days as the sole person in produce. I know Nick atleast appreciates my efforts, but what do i get for it? TM II should be considered for those that go beyond in just FE and are knowledgeable in other departments.","272":"As stated previously, front-end at Hertel is messy. There aren't really any operating standards and when it comes to training, it's lackluster at best. Bringing back specialized trainers to help lessen this gap would be super helpful. Even if it isn't it's own position, a pay bump for those willing & capable of training when needed would be nice. Not all supervisors make good trainers, and having people read and book & then watch someone cash for a day isn't good training.\n\nThis has gotten better since our FEM change, but for awhile I felt singled out by our previous supervisor/FEM duo, leading to write ups I'm pretty sure no one else has something similar to.","273":"See previous comments on understaffing issues. On days where there's only one person in a department, you can tell. Front-end only has so many people/man hours to send to other departments. I appreciate that when we're busy other departments help cash, but when I know they're already understaffed on a day, they shouldn't have to.","274":"On my wage, I cannot afford our health benefits. I also can't make a real meaningful contribution to the 401k, but a couple bucks a week is better than nothing.\n\nOn floating holidays:Why don't we get a full 5 days? We're open Easter, I feel like a floating day for Easter or your spring religious holiday of choice would be a reasonable ask.\n\nWhen it comes to my position, though my wage is \"high\"for a cashier (ignoring Aldi anyway), I still feel under-compensated for the knowledge I have gained storewide. As someone who has learned how to busy myself in 3 different departments without a lot of manager aid (IE Bakehouse, Grocery & Produce), a small paybump to demonstrate that this knowledge is valuable to the co-op would be greatly appreciated, otherwise, whats the point of all the extra work other than to stop other departments from floundering since they're understaffed?","275":"Paid time off|Sick time|Floating holidays|Vision insurance","276":"The numbers are nice and all, but I'd like to see hard \"did we profit\"numbers. The numbers I see really mean nothing unless given the context of how successful we were any week/group of weeks. Maybe even including weekly operating costs would help lessen that gap for me.","277":"This mostly goes back to my comments previously on not being really heard by management. A lot of \"we'll fix that\"or \"we'll look into changing things\"but no real action.\n\nFor front end, there are really no standard operating procedures, everyone does things a little differently, which is fine, but also leads to downfalls like people in front end not knowing how to do certain tasks since they were never shown how, leading to someone like myself having to show them.\n\nFor changes for my role, I'm going to talk scheduling. I know variability in my schedule is part of the job, but there are weeks where I work all opening shifts and then close randomly in the middle of the week. This absolutely shouldn't be acceptable, no person should be expected to entirely flip their sleep schedule within *one day* just for one shift, just to go back to their usual schedule within the next day or so","278":"When it comes to being supported and the concern for employee wellfare around various departments, a lot of departments feel overworked, stressed, and understaffed. As someone from from end, I'm able to go to various departments and see the strain they are under, and many express that they don't feel supported. I agree with their sentiment, if the co-op was properly staffed, I don't think front-end would be as vital into keeping departments afloat as they are. There are days where Grocery or Produce have 1 or even no people in them for most the day, and this is something that *needs* to change if you are looking to *actually* care about employee wellfare.\n\nEven in front end, on days where we *know* that we'll be busy, we're understaffed, leading to people stuck at registers for hours on end with no break, something that is both mentally and physically exhausting.\n\nI feel like when people bring up their concerns its a \"smile and nod\"situation, I've rarely seen things I've asked for actually changed or fixed, and I can only assume its the same for other departments. I overhear bake house saying how their input on changing recipes, or how grocery has made concerns about under staffing clear to management, yet nothing seems to change\n\nOn corrective action, managers always say that small offenses, like time cards or calling in under 4 hours (especially for this earlier shifts), won't add up to much and won't jeopardize your position or growth at the co-op. This is clearly not the case, as I know a couple people who have been held from promotion because of these minor infractions. If they are minor, they should be treated as such, and not used as a gotcha for not getting a promotion.","279":"Paylocity announcements|Open Book Management huddles","280":"I am incredibly proud to work for this co-op. I think its foundational to this area, otherwise we'd be in a food desert if this place didnt exist. I cant express enough how there is a very old work culture here that was warped due to covid, and now there is so much inaction based on comfortably/no motivation to make changes that it leads to alot of folks not working to the best of their ability. Lots of folks to just come in to make a pay check it feels.","281":"Concerning the dept head, I do feel like its reasonable to say that there is an incredible amount of inaction that leads to alot of frustration & lack of motivation amongst workers because we recognize that even our managers don't care because they understand how hard it is to change things around here.","282":"In the kitchen, it is my opinion that training is the most lacking aspect of onboarding. New team members spend a maximum of two days shadowing a current TM learning a station. New TM are taught the basics of their station, recipes, etc, but the rest such as cleaning, station breakdown, are left to basically learn as you go. when bringing discrepancies up to MNGT, i feel it falls on deaf ears when wanting to bring change about poor working habits.","283":"sure, i do agree that HR concerns are dealt with in a confidential manner. however, HR is very slow moving & because of their small size, it feels like they lack communication.","284":"the kitchen has this culture of passing the buck to the next shift/supervisor, i feel the kitchen is in a vicious circle of that needs a big culture shift.","285":"because of my shift, I do not get to see alot of the inner workings that happen day to day, hour by hour","286":"Wish we could buy shrink at a further discounted price potentially, other than that, I give two thumbs up","287":"i dont know how to recognize this in the workplace.","288":"As of late, there are a few instances of potential targeting coaching/write-ups when concerning our POC employees.

The communication tools listed (need to know, paylocity announcements, huddles, postings) are effective for the big picture and specific things, but countless other daily things get lost and uncommunicated.

It can feel very monotonous and soul sucking. I feel like the expectation on the front end is a little tighter than expectations for other departments--it doesn't feel like we can maneuver through the role without being micromanaged. The job is a bit boring as well, with little to no change in routine on the day to day.","374":"Not a lot of effective communication on opportunities to gain more knowledge/seek promotion opportunities. Employee development plans are not made clear and have also been put onto the back burner.","375":"I feel included and respected by the employees in my department (not so much management), however I feel a major lack of respect from the customers that we serve.","376":"The cashiers need more stools. It makes no sense for there to be one stool for like 10 cashiers.

I can barely afford our products right now.","378":"What is this?","379":"Workplace communication or daily operations is extremely efficient. I am pretty much always aware of what my day is going to look like, and of any changes, as management check ins are pretty frequent throughout the work day. Communication on larger scale topics are a miss for me though. I have received the run around for weeks on things that I was promised to be followed up on, unclear or changing expectations, and a lack or prioritization for certain things to be communicated as a whole.","380":"I believe that the Co-op has a bit of ways to go when it comes to curating a safe and fair work environment for its employees. I do not think any of the concerns that I have brought to management has made it to a conversation in which action can be taken. In fact, I feel as if management consistently sweeps issues and concerns under the rug unless they specifically involve or have to do with the customer that we serve. In moments where more equity, inclusion, and diversity could have been discussed and expanded upon, I found management to be a bit unresponsive and lacking a sense of urgency to address these issues.","381":"While I think that the Co-op does a good job at providing local and organic food to our local community, and definitely presents a \"community first\"mindset, I also believe that the role of the employees as a part of that community tends to be overlooked, so much so that the employees have the potential to become unheard or unacknowledged.","382":"Staff discount|Paid time off","383":"The front end staff are constantly doing other departments jobs and sent to do tedious sometimes very gross cleaning tasks. I understand that we have to keep busy and that our shifts sometimes overlap. But some of these tasks just don't seem fair compared to what were being paid. There is an upside to this, we get a break from the register. But in reality were getting paid to do one job, when sometime we worked 2 other departments in the same day while being called back and forth to the register all day. I can freely say that a lot of us feel burnt out by the end of our shift sometimes even by the end of our lunch. I would really appreciate a raise for all this work, or at the very least a solution that supervisors and employees can feel comfortable with.","384":"Things are getting better, but my department had a very rough year. I'm tentatively optimistic that things are turning around, but I'd like to see a new FEM in here ASAP to start focusing on some of our longstanding issues.","385":"This is a reflection of Seth as my supervisor, not my previous FEM.","386":"We have no centralized training practices to help define our training programs. Depending on skill levels, people enter the fray long before their training is wrapped up. I think we're doing a better job lately, but I ultimately feel that's because we're slower than in the summer and fall, and have more room to help people. I don't see us keeping this up in the summer, which is when training tends to suffer. \n\nAs for diversity and inclusion training - I would never categorize a corporate video on inclusion effective. I heard that the more senior managers have witnessed trainings on inclusion in the grocery industry and co - op world - but that content isn't available to anyone else.","387":"Staff discount|Paid time off|Sick time|Floating holidays|Retirement plan","388":"Paylocity announcements|Weekly Need to Know|Open Book Management huddles|Postings (in the breakroom| etc.)","389":"I have never brought a claim of harassment to HR that was acted on appropriately since Denise left. Sure, things have been confidential, but I've been harassed multiple times at this job, only to get a sheepish \"I'm sorry that happened\"from a senior manager months later. I do not share these things anymore because I have no confidence that HR or senior management will take them, or me, seriously in this regard.","390":"I think the Co-op has great overall goal, but they are not there yet. There is so much room for improvement on managements side and workers side too. More specifically; I think management has to work on their communication skills. An example that I have seen/ experienced is micro agressions in the workplace. There is a supervisor who is not educated on neat hairstyles, and made an employee uncomfortable wearing their hair a certain way. \n\nOn another note, the Co-Op has not upheld their mission statement to their fullest capabilities. Most of our products come from a place that has inflicted violence on an oppressed people. This does not refelct concern for the comunity, nor does it nurture the enviroment. We have to do better. The store has \"Food for People Not for Profit\"plastered on our walls yet we contribute to a country that is actively involved in a genocide. I think we should do more to look into where our products are really coming from and be cautious of what we put out on our shelves.\n\nMy last concern is accepting each others differences. This is really hard on the front end, I think a lot of employees are critical of each other but we have to remember that not everyone is the same. I bring this up because there have been many instances of emplyoees not getting along and taking their petty complaints to a supervisor. In turn these complaints turn into write ups and put a target on peoples backs, which is not fair. Per the employee handbook, small problems should be handeled between coworkers. Maybe we should have the steward as a mediator for these small issuess or have the supervisor sit the emplyees down and also act as a mediator. Supervisors also get wrapped up into the pettiness, when they should be a nuetral party. I think they need to be reminded of that to prevent negative energy or a hostile work enviroment.","391":"Overall Operations:For all of last year, our department had no goals and zero consistency. We were poorly managed with no KPIs or metrics to read, a lack of transparency from our department manager, and extremely poor communication practices. Our manager was often dishonest about personnel and customer issues, uncommitted to long term goals, and demonstrated poor social boundaries that affected her in-store credibility and working relationships, especially with our own department's team members. She developed a reputation for being absent whenever a department manager would be needed the most. We are still recovering from that as a department, and are down a dedicated operations manager. \n\nDiscipline - Our previous FEM was unfair in who she focused on in terms of discipline, company culture, etc, and encouraged this sort of behavior through her example. She chose not to write people up consistently because she personally didn't agree with our policies, which then put us in a position of being written up by the store manager for rules the FEM said she was not enforcing. She also did not track any of these write ups. It would be up to me to tell her people needed to be written up, or else it would not happen. She executed documented coachings up to 3 weeks after the incidents at times. We are doing a better job of this now, but our intense focus on communication and discipline expectations is very recent. \n\nExpectations / consistency:Our previous manager changed my schedule and almost every cashier's schedule every single week. She would often would tell me the schedule was going to be one thing (usually whatever it was that I wanted to hear), only for me to find out it was another when she published it on my days off. I asked for a certain schedule multiple times a month for a year, while Nick's schedule rarely, if ever, changed. I was told that my additional flexibility was expected as I have less seniority than her and Nick, which is also the reason she told me she was putting me on random cashing shifts through the week. We spoke about this many times. It never changed, until she left, and Seth started writing the schedule instead. I still do not feel comfortable saying that expectations are consistent, as all these improvements are very recent, and the frustrations of 2023 are still fresh in this department. \n\nWe are *currently* also working on some things that have come to our attention - across the board, we need to do better with consistency in expectations. It seems we tend to focus on poor performers, which is a habit we all need reminding of from time to time. \n\nOrganization:We had a FEM who did not know, a year into her job, that new flyers get dispersed on Wednesday mornings, and it's up to our department to take care of it. This is just one example of the lack of ownership and organization our department has been through for over a year.The schedule was often posted many, many days late. We haven't had a real front end supervisor meeting since... September? That's terrible for department organization. I would come back from vacations and leaves and have zero communication about personnel changes, new trainings I needed to complete, or changed policies. I would find out by making mistakes on these things, and being corrected by Finance and other parties. \n\nVision and Morale:We are continuing to recover from the mismanagement of personnel and the department responsibilities, but it has left our department with low morale. We still do not have a defined vision of what are department should look like, and when we hope to look like that. We never truly know how many positions we have open, or what a \"fully staffed\"department should consist of in terms of labor and spread of availability. \n\nOrganization:Our department has thoroughly lacked organization until recently, when I was tasked with keeping up with accountability tracking and the PLU books, and Seth became in charge of the schedule. These are responsibilities that we were told were \"next to impossible\"to keep track of, while our former FEM blamed her lack of results on senior management giving her an unimaginable amount of work. These responsibilities are not at a challenge. It takes me just a few minutes a week to manage this, which anyone would've found out if she let them try it themselves. We need an experienced, organized manager who knows how to do these things, leaving that extra energy for hands-on management and being available. \n\nThat all said, we are improving since then to create more organizational systems and an internal dept. culture of accountability. Things are moving smoother since I started overseeing personnel communication and accountability tracking, and since Seth took over the schedule, but we have a long way to go before I'd say \"we're producing quality work\"or that we're \"well organized\".","392":"It looks to me as though our HR Department is spread so thin that they aren't able to respond to issues is in a timely way.","393":"Sick time|Paid time off|Retirement plan|Staff discount","394":"It doesn't feel as though we are practicing open book management consistently or deeply.","395":"Maybe I don't know the best way to communicate with management.I have given up making suggestions because there is no meaningful response.","396":"The processes you are asking about are not transparent.I don't know what is happening with other employees.","397":"The Coop is a wonderful community resource.We have a lot to learn about diversity & inclusion in our stores and community.I look forward to the day we embody that.I also wonder why we spend so much effort, time and resources on \"competing\"with our local grocery stores on their terms (cheap food that doesn't nourish and other items that aren't durable).I think this has left our core shoppers without the things they have traditionally come here for.","398":"We run a lot of processes inefficiently, quite a few too many to list. Some top examples:\n\nI have heard from all daytime PFD supervisors that their OVNT counterparts are not held accountable to production output or speed. This has been reported the entire time I've been here, with many examples that seem pretty clearly inefficient / poorly managed. I hear we are moving baking back to overnight to move a team member to a different shift, which to me is perplexing. I thought we created a baker position because OVNT didn't have time to do this? And they already struggle with effective / efficient production.\n\nBecause we are staffed bare bones / skeleton style, if one cashier calls out, someone else's work suffers. If one department team member calls out, the MOD is responsible for making up for that absence if possible, which makes them less available to team members, admin project time, and other operations needs. This also makes training impossible to keep up with when we roll out training initiatives. This barebones staffing creates a reactionary business model and problem-solving culture, which by definition is inefficient, as we're playing whackamole rather than using our time effectively to analyze and plan. We've had multiple instances of a grocery team member going on leave, and the plan is always \"work harder\". That's not a plan, nor is it efficient. We've been pitching a float shift or position for years, but we want to \"Save on payroll\"as if we don't have multiple call outs every single day, which would make up for this additional role. \n\nThe lack of urgency around hiring, orientation, and promoting staff is truly baffling at times. HR is a major recruiting bottleneck, has been for at least a year. I have been told by HR coordinators to try to screen applicant calls and tell them they didn't get the job if they didn't hear back within a couple weeks. That is inefficient and unethical. We don't even have an automatic \"No Thank You\"to applicants we're not interested in? This creates a lot of extra communication that the MOD has become responsible for during store hours. \n\nI have needed the help of other departments on a busy day with a lack of cashiers, and they ignore calls for help at the registers. This isn't necessarily their faults per se - they are also understaffed and busy. \n\n","399":"The HR department has not had the best track record of getting back to employees in a timely manner.","400":"I've worked at the Coop for a long time. I recommend it to some people who are looking for work occasionally but it is a place that has its quirks and things to work on.","401":"My manager is great! I feel like I can always talk to her.","402":"I haven't had orientation in MANY years, I have no idea what they talk about these days. Also, the evaluations asked about are more like chats between workers and managers.","403":"I think the kitchen is one of the most chaotic departments to run! There are many different skill levels and forms of communication, and a lot of information to get across from shift to shift. I rely on basecamp and my manager as well as other co-workers to help make sure things get across. I don't think everyone is always held to the same standards.","404":"On a day-to-day basis, I feel like the people in charge of running the store could always use more support. When I need to communicate to Elmwood, I just use basecamp or tell my manager, hoping someone sees it.","405":"Medical insurance|Paid time off|Sick time|Floating holidays|Retirement plan","406":"I think it's interesting we have access to the numbers for the Coop, but what can employees do about them? We aren't given many tools to help.","407":"Communication could absolutely improve!!!!!! I find from shift to shift, there are many people who haven't been informed of what's happened previously or to come. Also, I literally say every day \"I have no idea what's going on here anymore.\"","408":"Paid time off|Sick time","409":"While I do have criticisms of the coop, it's only because I think we all could do a whole lot better. In the end, I do believe my managers are good people who are trying to do a good job, and a lot of our issues are systemic and habitual, I would like to us change some of these habits, and make common sense changes to make our workplace better. \n\nI have felt more valued at work, but haven't since I've been working more nights. None of my managers or upstairs staff are here to see a good portion of my work. And while the discrepancy in when I work to when they work (none of them are here til close, indicating to me that this is a valuable time for me to be working) I often feel left out of what's happening at the coop. My jobs hours are also extreme, they're either extremely early or extremely late and one of the only jobs (other than cashier/ovnt supervisor) where the coop literally needs a replacement to do the job or else the store can't function, we are often not appreciated as such.","410":"I do believe my supervisor is trying his best and believe he is a good person. This goes a long way for me to trust in him and the department. There are times where I feel he could communicate more clearly and directly, and often feel like he is careful with info and conversations to the point where its not worth bringing him in on everything. Instead of getting a response he'll defer to just listening and nodding, seemingly more worried than confident. I hope he feels more confident as he gains more experience in the job.","411":"Our orientation program needs a strong revamp. It's so slow to get employees in and working, and we've even cancelled and delayed orientations for very needed staff because of only one participant in the orientation or we were waiting on our General Manager to come back from Vacation. These roadblocks are unnecessary and don't do a good job getting these employees in and working in a timely professional manner.\n\nMy job does not spark or use any of my creativity, thoughtfulness or creativity. While there are aspects where I can employ these things, it's mostly in my day-to-day interactions with staff and customers. To be fair, these are the most rewarding aspects of my job, but the actual tasks of my job, checking temperatures, making sure every aspect of the deposit is properly logged in the right spot and keeping track of all of the new things that are added every year to check off before the night is over, is not exactly leaving me with a sense of accomplishment.","412":"I feel I don't know enough to comment on this one.","413":"We have been without a department manager for a good chunk of time, and without a competent department manager for much longer. I feel like our standards have slipped over time from when I had highly organized department managers who are either no longer here or work in other departments. Having a capable department manager could go a long way towards making our department's work even better.\n\nOn the other hand I did not apply for this position even though I've been a MOD and supervisor for over 7 years because I feel like the coop's senior leadership team doesn't support department managers in a way that keeps people working in those roles. I have seen too many department managers leave completely burnt out, because we're unable to foster an environment that creates and sustains top talent from working here. We've lost too many people over the years because they feel unheard, over worked, and under supported.","414":"I do feel like Hertel is an island at this point. I don't feel involved on what's going on there or if we're headed in the right direction financially. I frequently look at their sales and worry that it still hasn't hit its stride. At first I feel like both stores were much more connected and now it very much feels like it's own entity, separate from our operations here until we get in another staffing emergency that requires us to send staff over. \n\nIn terms of cooperation from people in other departments I feel like I get it from some and not others. I'm thinking of cooperation as communication and support. I often work at night when almost all of our department managers (not grocery, who often makes herself available to help out at night) are never here. I'm running the ship completely without their help, unable to count on them for support or to help in any meaningful way.","415":"I have no issues with my pay or benefits.","416":"Medical insurance|Paid time off|Sick time|Floating holidays|Retirement plan|Staff discount","417":"I feel this used to be more true. Before Hertel opened Tim was much more available at our Huddles to explain goals and the financials of the coop. Tim has a wealth of store knowledge that he can speak to clearly that we are currently missing at all of our huddles. The financial focused meetings once per quarter from Tom are engaging and the best example we currently have of open book management. Everything else feels farther away than it used to.","418":"We do not communicate effectively at all. I often find myself surprised by policy changes/focus/direction/and important info that I would like to know in advance that helps me do my job. Our communication style is opaque, it's often vague, and often leaves out important details that I'd like to know that would help me properly address it with our team. I can't tell you how many times information has been disseminated throughout the coop with the phrase \"if you have any questions please ask your MOD\"when we have not been given any clear instruction on what the information is or had any input in. \n\nI'd like to see us work on this, but have begun to give up on change, it's been like this since I started here over a decade ago, with not true indicator that it will get better. We so very often seem to miss very clear and easy to predict problems that will arise, which makes the coop seem thoughtless and flat-footed. Unable to predict how our employees will take in our communications/policies/and responses to community events.\n\nRecently we had a supervisors/managers retreat where the supervisors were not given any clear instructions on meeting goals or purpose. Supervisors were almost immediately separated from department managers, making our input seem less important and even unwanted. I'm very rarely asked for my input even though I've been here for over a decade and have asked multiple times in my reviews for avenues to give feedback and input that would affect the decision making at the coop. My team has had no actual department meetings that were scheduled in the conference room in months.\n\n","419":"I am constantly disappointing by the choices made by upper management. The biggest reason behind me staying at this job is my coworkers, and my direct supervisor, who has worked hard to create a good work environment in our department. I think that the Co-op can be a lovely place to work, but the constant exhaustion in the store, due to under staffing and the inability for upper management to take issues seriously makes it harder then it should be. It feels as if we are never fully staffed in this store. I suggest having front-end employees have one shift a week in a different department might help with the inability to keep full time cashiers as this job, and help out the other departments in turn,.","420":"Obviously our training programs need to be updated if employees feel comfortable enough to throw hateful and discriminatory comments around in the workplace.","421":"Management has shown me time and time again they don't take seriously concerns of equity, inclusion and diversity. This is reflected in interactions with costumers who have been allowed to continually harass employees for far too long with out retaliation by the store, employees who make hateful comments, and management who doesn't take these concerns seriously.","422":"I don't know if management's practices truly reflect a commitment to equity, inclusion and diversity because I feel we always could be doing better. I don't think it's something we're great at, because I think we're still learning. I don't think our management team still doesn't reflect the diverse nature of our community, which has been an issue since I started at the Coop.","423":"I don't believe we're truly living up to the principles of the coop as it was originally founded. While I do think there's a unique difference between our store and something like Wegmans, the thought of us being democratically controlled is at best mostly false. Most of our decisions and the way the store ultimately runs is through our General Manager. Change is slow, we're not agile at all. I don't see a strong correlation between what the board does and what the coop does.\n\nAt the moment we operate more like how most businesses operate, trying to increase profits, stay afloat, and ultimately expand. I don't see how this helps me do a better job of serving our customers.","424":"HR doesn't seem truly concerned with the the practice of protecting employees from hate speech, discrimination and harassment. The way in which these issues are dealt with is embarrassing as a whole. Hate speech should not be tolerated at this store, and these concerns need to be taken seriously, especially in light of current political situations. We need to either properly dealt with these situations through training or we need a no-tolerance policy for hate-speech, harassment, and violence.","425":"My supervisor has always supported me and my department in the best way he could.","426":"If the book is open, the pages are blank","427":"I feel as if tasks such as keeping the department clean and organized get lost and ignored by other coworkers, not matter how many times I bring it up.","428":"I only feel compensated fairly for my work post-unionization of this store, previously it felt as if the Co-op avoided raises and promotions for employees.","429":"The delayed response about concerns I've had made it seem as if the issues I've brought up weren't taken seriously. It feels as if the upper management doesn't care how their employees feel about the practices at this workplace.","430":"I don't see a concern for the community reflected in recent actions. How can we be nurturing the local community and environment if we are inadvertently sending our and our costumers money towards a country that is committing a genocide as we speak? I don't feel as if continuing to carry products from Israel is in line with our values as a Co-op.","431":"Open Book Management huddles|Postings (in the breakroom| etc.)|Weekly Need to Know","432":"Despite some of my comments and answers I am overall satisfied with my job. I am critical because i can see how this could be a truly great place to work if some steps were taken to change and improve a few things. I am happy, just wish it could be a little better. The corporate feel to management doesn't help, but I've dealt with worse.","433":"Most supervisors are good, but some do lack. The ones who lack are allowed to continue their bad performance with no changes made, which creates distrust and a lack of respect from workers.","434":"Because we are short staffed, training is not always up to par and what it should be. The workers are relied upon heavily to train/help each other.","435":"Until recently I felt HR was following best practices, but due to recent decisions I do not feel this way anymore.","436":"As stated before, there is a clear divide within the department. Some people really care and excel at their job while others do not, and yet management does not do anything to change the situation. This creates frustration and resentment within the organization, despite us all mostly getting along.","437":"I appreciate the benefits, but also believe all employees should get them. The store discount seems very low to me and kind of disrespectful. I'm not saying we should get everything free (though one can dream), but the percentage is low. \n\nWithin PFD there are some positions and shifts that are a lot more challenging and require more work than others. Despite rotations, some people are allowed to not partake in these roles while others are leaned on more to work in these roles. It feels unfair and creates frustration and resentment.","438":"Not sure I know what open book management means. I can take a pretty educated guess, but it's still a guess.","439":"Communication lacks in PFD. A change will be randomly made and the workers end up needing to tell each other of these changes. The only other way to find out is to eventually be reprimanded by the person who made said change when they observe a worker not complying because they did not know. It truly is demoralizing and a bad system. This also applies to scheduling as sometimes changes occur with no notice. I get that we need to stay on top of our schedules, but if a schedule is consistent and randomly changes, a heads up seems like an easy thing to do to ensure everyone is on the same page.\n\nAs far as general store communication goes, I think it can also improve. Managers and people who have been working at the store for a while assume new hires automatically know how all the store events and procedures work, which is an absurd assumption to make.","440":"I feel that management falls short in supporting workers. Helping and respecting \"the community\"is often preached, but workers aren't included as part of \"the community\"being referenced. Customers are often allowed to disrespect and treat workers poorly and the workers have to take it. I get that we need customers to be happy and return, but they should not be allowed to treat the workers so poorly with no consequences. Many times the offenders are repeat customers known to everyone and still allowed to behave however they want. If it was the other way around I have no doubt the workers would be reprimanded or more and that seems unfair. We are part of this oft discussed \"community\"and should be treated as such.","441":"The Co-op is overall a good place but nowhere near perfect. Still a lot of work to do.","442":"MOD-trained managers should get a pay differential, as should Front End Supervisors. We are held at a higher accountability for attendance and adhering to retail floor policy. The store cannot open or close without a front end supervisor. \n\nThe MOD ops leaders was supposed to alleviate this issue. \"MODs feel like they can't call out\"was part of the original pitch to us in November 2022. Nothing has changed. \n\nSupervisors in PFD and Grocery have called out fifteen minutes before their shift and the store has always been fine. This simply could never happen on the front end, as evidenced by four times last year I had PFD supervisors calling my cell phone at 7 am- because the morning front end supervisor overslept.","443":"Medical insurance|Dental insurance|Vision insurance|Paid time off|Floating holidays|Retirement plan|Staff discount|Sick time","444":"I know about our business at the co-op because I ask people how their jobs work, not because of management transparency or huddles.","445":"We deeply struggle with workplace communication at the co-op. This is the first company I've ever worked where it is acceptable for your managers to simply not respond to your emails in any way. I had a manager complain to me that she despised email and avoided working on her emails on a regular basis. She, too, rarely responded to any of my emails while she worked here. \n\nI get lots of feedback on the things that go wrong with my emails, which is fair, but I don't see any improvement from my superiors on how they handle their own communication issues. It reads like we're afraid to commit to or even mention anything in writing? I work in a department whose leaders work varying shifts that don't often overlap - communication in email is essential. It's rare that my questions in email are ever answered in writing - usually verbally, and only when I follow up several days later. \n\nProcesses have changed while I've been away on vacation, and I have found out by getting critiqued that I did something \"the old way\". \n\nWe will wait for weeks and weeks to turn someone down for a promotion or internal transfer, when the answer is often known right away.\n\nI have called employees that didn't show up to work asking where they were - several times this year, they had gotten the OK from a manager or HR to not use the call in line because they're on leave, but no one told their scheduled supervisor, or helped make a plan for their absence. \n\nWe don't have a consistent / reliable process for ensuring escalated / unsafe customer issues are handled with attention and care to our employees. This has gone poorly in a myriad of ways. In one instance, I reported pervasive sexual harassment from a customer. It wasn't investigated for many months (only once I realized she was running for the board), and that investigation only ended with an apology to me and no further action. I still cash her out and have to help her regularly, despite her outrageous comments about my body and her feelings for me.\n\nA lot of the inbound communication to HR is handled by MODs, which feels incorrect / unethical / unfair. There is no one to take inbound HR calls at most moments, but there are people trying to apply for positions we need filled urgently. We have no way to help them, and they feel left behind by us as a potential employer. \n\nThere are many more to add to this list. Our communication is extremely poor as an organization.","446":"I think we struggle with equity and equal accountability across the board. Some departments are held to much higher standards of accountability than others. PFD is reputable for being very lax with the scheduling, rules, and communication, whereas in Front End and Grocery all little details are taken extremely seriously and schedules are never a constant / employee-favored. In PFD, if someone requests PTO, the work list just gets shuffled and people just have more work to get done that day. If someone requests PTO on the front end, the entire team schedule is affected in order to keep our staffing levels the same every day. This isn't purely black and white in real life application, but this is the ongoing trend that most all team members recognize, and because everyone is paid the same across departments, it often feels like our department is paid the same amount as others for higher expectations and more schedule stress. \n\nI spent at least a year with a different schedule each and every week, whereas my counterparts in PFD have worked the same schedule 90 percent of the time they've worked here. Front End Supervisors are held to higher standards of accountability and attendance than other supervisors, but are paid on the same scale. I've been specifically told by management that only using the call out line four hours before my shift is not enough notice, and to communicate with ops and and Store Manager 24 hours in advance if possible. I have never seen another department supervisor held to that standard.\n\nWe struggle with communication and execution strategy across the board as well. We were supposed to move out of the Front End Supervisors as MODs model, announced a year and a half ago, but it seems we gave up on that idea and have decided to just continue making MODs, which was a prediction made by one of our supervisors when the plan was announced. Hertel had already moved towards that model when this was announced so long ago. \n\nWe are going into our third month without a Front End Manager and it feels like we aren't any further along in getting one than when I asked a few weeks ago. This means we won't have a settled manager until sometime in the summer. This lack of urgency affects all departments, as other ops managers have to take inconvenient MOD shifts that not all of them are trained for or have the time to run. I haven't received any meaningful communications about this position, even though it greatly affects my work life and my livelihood as a direct report. \n\nAs for feedback and ideas, until recently, I was treated as the very loud squeaky wheel rather than an experienced professional with insights, and had given up on providing feedback and ideas. Things have recently gotten a little better, but I'm still hesitant to push back on things, or point out things that feel ineffective or unethical.","447":"I think that we struggle with managing marginalized people. While we are doing better at hiring a more diverse workforce, that comes with some cultural competency education that I think we are lacking - in terms of managing people with different socioeconomic experiences than our own. I've never been educated in a meaningful way regarding the issues getting healthy food in our food systems -most of it has been things I've taken the initiative to learn myself since working here.","448":"I am not sure about my potential to be promoted.","449":"I do think that the rate of pay for my position is below the average rate of pay in the area.Also, the line of work my position does shouldn't be grouped in with other pay scales in the store that do different work.","450":"For me, the weekly huddles really help me stay in the loop with the co-op and stayed informed with anything going on with upcoming events, sales, etc.","451":"I believe management respects the rights of their employees in my own personal experiences.","452":"I believe the Co-op follows it's principles it has laid out.","453":"Medical insurance|Dental insurance|Vision insurance|Paid time off|Sick time|Retirement plan|Floating holidays|Staff discount","454":"The only reason I don't \"strongly agree\"on Question #53 is there are younger people in my department who are rude, presumptuous, and judgemental, and I suppose that's based on age. But that's difficult to parse out. I understand there is no corrective action for ignorance.","455":"Postings (in the breakroom| etc.)|Open Book Management huddles|Paylocity announcements|Weekly Need to Know","456":"I partly agree/disagree on Question #2 because while I know it's standard to have prepared foods and coffee in grocery stores now -- and I like the way the co-op carries that out compared to other stores -- I don't believe grocery stores in general should have prepared foods and coffee. It cultivates a sense of entitlement among customers who are well-off enough to buy prepared foods and coffee, but won't go to a restaurant or cafe where one needs to tip and be polite to workers. To me, that breeds advantage-taking of food service workers. I encounter many, many customers who think our kitchen is a restaurant where they can request whatever they want, made to order.","457":"Paylocity announcements|Open Book Management huddles|Postings (in the breakroom| etc.)","458":"Staff discount|Retirement plan|Floating holidays|Sick time|Paid time off","459":"overall i love working here,major things we need to work on:addressing broken equipment promptly, holding staff accountable consistently, better training, protecting staff from harassment from customers and vendors","460":"staff is inconsistently held accountable","461":"coordinator positions were eliminated a few years back, making promotion within less likely. We do not have well laid out trainings and on boardings. i have not been to an orientation in years but there are many simple things that most new staff do wrong and i’m curious how these issues are covered in orientation.","462":"although i feel that staff is not going to be retaliated against for bringing up harassment concerns. I know that all claims are not taken seriously and have at times been ignored","463":"often the department is not on the same page and new systems fail quickly because not everyone buys in and staff is not held accountable for keeping up with systems expectations","464":"the kitchen sink was broken for months, took way too long to replace. i feel like management doesn’t always act efficiently to fix broken things that staff use everyday. certain equipment can go months without being seriously addressed. sink and cooler in kitchen, bakery freezer, produce door. all of these things make it harder for coworker to get work done and all took months to replace","465":"Retirement plan|Paid time off|Staff discount|Sick time","466":"What is \"Open Book Management\"?","467":"i know how we are doing week to week but have no idea how well the coop is doing financially overall. there used to be a cash line in our huddles but that went away during the pandemic","468":"I often don’t get responses to emails from my two manager and have to follow up often and still things don’t get done or addressed. it is very frustrating","469":"Paylocity announcements|Weekly Need to Know|Open Book Management huddles","470":"Strong personal regret that the union has organized at the Lexington Co-op..I see no benefit whatsoever to union invovlement and strongly regret the lower wages as a result of required union dues.","471":"management is not consistent in holding staff accountable across the stores","472":"The only reason I clicked \"disagree\"for employee handbook usefulness is because I know the current version is outdated. I know we are working on updating it with the Union contract, until then, I will refer to the union contract","473":"Management requires more help, initiative, volunteerism, passion, drive, etc from the admin teams and store teams to create the change and vision they want to see. The answers to how to evolve in the area of DEIB do not rely solely with one person/manager/department. We need to continue to create a culture of empowerment, openness and change.
