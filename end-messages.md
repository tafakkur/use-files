Thank you for taking the time to complete the survey.    
Dear ${e://Field/Name},

Thank you.

Before you leave, I would like you to know a few things about the survey you have just completed.

Firstly, the context of this study was blood donations, but we are not limited to just blood donations are will also be sharing our results with NGOs involved in other social causes. So, your help is not going to be limited to just people in need of blood.

Secondly, you may have experienced various server failures and errors during the survey. They were on purpose. The objective of this study was to see the impact of different types of advertising on the level of inconveniences people are willing to go though. If you were irate, I hope you no longer are.

Lastly, if you've given us your email id, we will be sharing with you the results of the study when they come out. If there's anything else that you'd like to know or would want to help us more. Please get in touch through the details mentioned below.

Once again thank you for your time. You have been a greater help than you know.

Mandatory Plug: Please share this survey with as many people as you can. Who knows, maybe they get inspired to donate blood by watching one of the videos. (There are multiple. Sorry if you had to sit through the boring one.)

Thank you for your time.
Your responses have been noted.
If you had entered an email id at the start, we shall send you the result of the study once it ends.

We would really appreciate if you could please share the survey with a few people. The response rate is low and increasing blood donations is urgent.
